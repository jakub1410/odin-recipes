    <h1>Schnitzel</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Although closely linked with Vienna (Wiener means “Viennese” in German), the Schnitzel actually <strong>originated in Milan, Italy.</strong></p>
        <p>The dish is not one of those traditions only found in tourism brochures. It really is a hugely popular meal in Austrian homes, though most families use pork rather than veal (see later).</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound veal, scallopini cut</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place veal on a clean work surface and sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place flour in a flat dish. Beat egg and parsley together in a second dish. Place bread crumbs in a third dish. Dredge each veal cutlet first in flour, then in egg-parsley mixture, followed by bread crumbs, pressing down so that bread crumbs adhere.</li>
                <li>Spray the basket of the air fryer with nonstick cooking spray. Place breaded veal cutlets into the basket, making sure not to overcrowd. Spray the tops with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Cook for 5 minutes. Flip, spray any chalky spots with nonstick cooking spray, and cook for 5 minutes longer. Repeat with remaining veal. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
            </ol>
